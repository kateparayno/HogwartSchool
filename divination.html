Divination is the art of predicting the future. Various methods are described, including<br> tea leaves, Fire-omens, Crystal balls, Palmistry, Cartomancy (including the reading <br>of conventional playing cards and the tarot), astrology, and Dream interpretations. <br>Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the most imprecise <br>branches of magic". Supporters of the subject claim that it is an inexact science that <br>requires innate gifts like the "Inner Eye". Those opposed claim that the subject is<br> irrelevant and fraudulent. Harry is first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney,<br> and then later by Firenze after Trelawney is sacked by Dolores Umbridge in Harry's<br> fifth year. In the sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney<br> teach Divination. The teachers of this class have been Professor Sybill Trelawney <br>(1980-1995) (1996-?) and Professor Firenze (1996-?).<br></p>
