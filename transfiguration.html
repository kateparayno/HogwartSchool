<h3> TRANSFIGURATION</h3><br>
</font>
<font color="#66ff99"> 
<p>Transfiguration is the art of changing the form or appearance of an object, and hence<br> this is what this class teaches. Transfiguration is a theory-based subject,<br> including topics such as "Switching Spells" (altering only a part of some object, such <br>as giving a human rabbit's ears); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely <br><br>disappear); and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air). It is possible <br>to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa â€” Minerva <br>McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigures her desk into a pig. The teachers of the <br>class have been Professor Albus Dumbledore (?-1957) and Professor Minerva McGonagall<br> (1957-1998).</p>
