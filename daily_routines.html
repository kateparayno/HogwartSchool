<h1>Daily Routines</h1>
<p>The day begins at 7:30 a.m. with breakfast in the Great Hall. During breakfast, the mail arrives in a flurry of hundreds of owls. A bell chime signals the start of the first class at 9 a.m. The bell chimes again in one hour to signal the start of the next class.</p>

<p>There are two class periods before lunch (though NEWT students may have breaks during some of these), scheduled according to house. After lunch, there is another break and two more classes.If there is a heavy snowstorm in between periods, certain lessons that take place outside (such as Herbology) may be cancelled, since it would be difficult for students to traverse from the castle to the outside.</p>

<p>Dinner is served in the Great Hall toward evening, after which the students are expected to be in their house common rooms for studying and socialising.</p>

<p>There is an Astronomy class at night on Wednesday every week (usually midnight).</p>

<p>The students must be in bed or in the common rooms by a certain time, after which is called after hours. The times are different for different years (for example, fifth years are allowed to be in the halls until 9:00 p.m.) </p>
