History of Magic is the study of magical history. Cuthbert Binns' lessons are depicted<br> as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause,<br> about significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin rebellions,<br> giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only class at Hogwarts<br> that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply <br>continued teaching as if nothing had changed. The only known teacher of this subject is <br>Professor Cuthbert Binns (17th or 18th century-?).</p>
