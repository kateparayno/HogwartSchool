Arithmancy is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. As <br> neither Harry nor Ron take this class, almost nothing is known about it. It is,<br> however, a favourite subject of Hermione. Arithmancy is reportedly difficult, as it <br>requires memorising or working with many charts. The subject is taught by Professor <br>Septima Vector. It is separated into normal Arithmancy and Advanced Arithmancy Studies,<br> the latter of which is taught by an unknown teacher (possibly Professor Vector). The<br> only known Arithmancy teacher is Professor Septima Vector (c. 1991-?, possibly <br>before).
