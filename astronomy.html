Astronomy is the only field of study at Hogwarts that has a direct equivalent in the <br>Muggle world. Astronomy classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in<br> Hogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observations<br> of the night skies with telescopes. Lessons are held every week at midnight, and<br> first years have lessons on Wednesday. Known student homework activities include<br> learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements,<br> and environments. The only known teacher of this class is Professor Aurora Sinistra<br> (c. 1991-?, possibly before).
