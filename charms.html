Charms the type of spell concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties,<br> and hence this class mainly consists on learning those sorts of spells. Charms<br> classes are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely <br>practical. Many of the exposition sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, <br>which are on the second floor of Hogwarts. The class is taught by Professor Flitwick <br>(c. 1976-?, possibly before).
