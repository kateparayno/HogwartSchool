Care of Magical Creatures is the class which instructs students on how to care for<br> magical beasts. Classes are held outside the castle. In Harry's first two years, the<br> class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then retires "in order to enjoy more<br> time with his remaining limbs". Dumbledore then recruits the gamekeeper Rubeus<br> Hagrid to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties. Although Hagrid<br>br> is obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he consistently misjudges the riskbr>
 that the animals he uses in his lessons pose to his students, which sometimes results<br> in chaos. When Hagrid is absent, his lessons are taken over by Professor<br> Grubbly-Plank, a witch and acquaintance of Dumbledore's.<br>

The teachers of this class have been Professor Silvanus Kettleburn (early 20th<br> century-1992), Professor Rubeus Hagrid (1993-?), and Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank<br> (1995) (temporarily).</p>
