<h1>The Four Houses of Hogwarts</h1>
<h2>Gryffindor</h2>
<p>Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by
Godric Gryffindor. Godric instructed the sorting hat to choose a few particular characteristics he most
values. Such character traits of students Sorted into Gryffindor are courage, chivalry, and determination.
The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold.Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington,
also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the house ghost.Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of
fire, and it is for that reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the House. The colour
of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the
coat.

<h2>Hufflepuff</h2>
<p>Hufflepuff is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the
medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work,
dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic
animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat
Friar is the House's patron ghost.Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth,and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.[4] The Hufflepuff points hourglass contains
yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing
to their correspondence to earth. </p>
<h2>Ravenclaw</h2>
<p>Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Rowena
Ravenclaw. Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. Its house colours are blue
and bronze, and its symbol is an eagle. The house ghost, who in life was the daughter of the house's founder
Rowena Ravenclaw, is the Grey Lady. Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air; the House
colours blue and bronze were chosen to represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do
with air.</p>
<h2>Slytherin</h2>
<p>Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar
Slytherin. Salazar instructed the sorting hat to choose a few particular characteristics he most valued. Such
character traits are cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition (during the time period the books and films take
place in, this house is mostly of pure-blood pure-blood supremacy, due to his mistrust of Muggle-borns, but
this discrimination does not last). Its emblematic animal is a snake and its colours are green and silver. The Head
of Slytherin is Horace Slughorn (who left the role to Severus Snape for fifteen years before taking it up again in
1996) and the House's patron ghost is the Bloody Baron.Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of
water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as
well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. The colours also correspond with waters around
lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rain water.</p>
<h1>Daily Routines</h1>
<p>The day begins at 7:30 a.m. with breakfast in the Great Hall. During breakfast, the mail arrives in a flurry of hundreds of owls. A bell chime signals the start of the first class at 9 a.m. The bell chimes again in one hour to signal the start of the next class.</p>

<p>There are two class periods before lunch (though NEWT students may have breaks during some of these), scheduled according to house. After lunch, there is another break and two more classes.If there is a heavy snowstorm in between periods, certain lessons that take place outside (such as Herbology) may be cancelled, since it would be difficult for students to traverse from the castle to the outside.</p>

<p>Dinner is served in the Great Hall toward evening, after which the students are expected to be in their house common rooms for studying and socialising.</p>

<p>There is an Astronomy class at night on Wednesday every week (usually midnight).</p>

<p>The students must be in bed or in the common rooms by a certain time, after which is called after hours. The times are different for different years (for example, fifth years are allowed to be in the halls until 9:00 p.m.) </p>
