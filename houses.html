The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold.Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington,<br>
also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the house ghost.Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of<br>
fire, and it is for that reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the House. The colour<br>
of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the<br>
coat. <br>

medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work,<br>
dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. The emblematic<br>
animal is a badger, and yellow and black are its colours. The Head of Hufflepuff is Pomona Sprout and the Fat<br>
Friar is the House's patron ghost.Hufflepuff corresponds roughly to the element of earth,and it is for that reason that the House colours were <br>chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil.[4] The Hufflepuff points hourglass contains<br>
yellow diamonds. Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing<br>
to their correspondence to earth. </p><br>

Slytherin" width="400" height="400"><br><br>
<p>Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Salazar<br>
Slytherin. Salazar instructed the sorting hat to choose a few particular characteristics he most valued. Such<br>
character traits are cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition (during the time period the books and films take<br>
place in, this house is mostly of pure-blood pure-blood supremacy, due to his mistrust of Muggle-borns, but<br>
this discrimination does not last). Its emblematic animal is a snake and its colours are green and silver. The Head<br>
of Slytherin is Horace Slughorn (who left the role to Severus Snape for fifteen years before taking it up again in<br>
1996) and the House's patron ghost is the Bloody Baron.Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of<br>
water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs in western European mythology, as<br>
well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. The colours also correspond with waters around<br>
