<b>Hogwarts Grounds</b><br>
Students shall not leave Hogwarts grounds.<br>
Students may leave with the Headmaster's permission, if collected by a parent or guardian.<br>
On the first and third weekends of each month, Third through Seventh Years may visit <br>Hogsmeade Village with a permission slip from the student's parent or guardian. Students<br> are free to travel to Hogsmeade after classes on Friday (3:00 pm) until curfew <br>(10:00 pm), when they are expected to be back in their dorms at Hogwarts. On Saturday <br>and Sunday they may from after breakfast (8:00 am) until curfew (10:00 pm) on the same day.<br>
Visitors to Hogwarts must obtain permission from the Headmaster or Deputy Headmaster.<br> This includes parents of students, and Ministry personnel.<br>
The only exceptions to this rule are members of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, who <br>have free access to the school.<br>
<b>Faculty Areas</b><br>
Students are forbidden from faculty areas. This includes the kitchen, faculty lounge,<br> and offices, unless with the escort or written permission of a faculty member. This <br>also includes classrooms when a class is not in session. (Note that class scenes don't<br> necessarily have to be run by staff. There is plenty of opportunity in classes for RP<br> that doesn't involve someone actively playing a professor. Feel free to pose<br> professors in the background for class scenes.)<br>
Prefects may enter faculty areas if investigating another student violating this rule.<br>
<b>House Areas</b><br>
Access to common rooms and dormitories is strictly controlled.<br>
Students may not enter the common rooms or dormitories of houses other than their own.<br> Each common room has a protective measure in place to restrict access. The Gryffindor<br> Tower and Slytherin Dungeon require passwords. Ravenclaw Tower requires the answer<br> to a riddle. The Hufflepuff Basement requires tapping a specific barrel in a<br> particular rhythm. Attempts to bypass these protective measures by members of other<br> houses are considered serious offences.<br>
Boys may not enter the girls' dormitories. Attempts to do so will trigger spells<br> preventing it, such as a Slide Spell on the staircases in the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw<br> rooms. The one exception to this is a male Prefect in an emergency.<br>
<b>Curfew</b><br>
Students must be in their dormitories and in bed by a 10:00 p.m. curfew.<br>
Students may not leave their house common rooms until 6:00 a.m.<br>
Prefects may be out of bed after hours if they are scheduled for patrol duty. Prefects <br>must still remain within the castle during patrols.<br>
<b>The Forbidden Forest</b><br>
The Forbidden Forest (a.k.a. the Dark Forest) is expressly forbidden to students without<br> a faculty escort. As of the 1938-39 term, students are forbidden from even<br> approaching the forest, due to the increased danger of the centaur clan conflicts.<br>
OOC: Do not enter the Forbidden Forest without staff supervision. If you want a scene in<br> the forest, put in a +request (and understand that there is a very good chance that<br> your character will not survive).<br>
<b>The Black Lake</b><br>
Swimming in the Black Lake is prohibited without faculty or Prefect supervision.<br>
Boating on the lake is prohibited without faculty permission.<br>
Though the juvenile Giant Squid is friendly, other inhabitants of the lake (such as<br> Grindylows and Selkies), and the cold itself, can be dangerous.<br>
<b>Restricted Section of the Library</b><br>
This area is roped off and forbidden to students, unless they present a signed <br>note from a professor.
Some notes will be for a specific book, some are for a specific subject. But students<br> are never given free access to every book in the Restricted Section.<br>
Books from the Restricted Section may not be removed from the Restricted Section. Books<br> must be taken to one of the desks provided in the section.<br>
<b>CONDUCT</b><br>
<b>Uniform</b><br>
Students shall be in uniform at all times while on Hogwarts grounds. This includes <br>robes, jumper, shirt, tie, slacks/skirt, shoes (Mary Janes for girls, dress shoes for<br> boys) and socks, and gloves and scarf when necessary. All articles must be kept neat <br>and tidy (i.e. shirt tucked in, tie worn properly, shoes polished, clothing washed and <br>without excessive wrinkles).<br>
Pointed hats are also part of the uniform, but are ceremonial in nature, and not<br> required except at special assemblies (e.g. the Start-of-Term and End-of-Term Feasts).<br>
Robes (but not the rest of the uniform) may be removed when not in class or at<br> assemblies (e.g. meals, after classes, weekends, etc.).<br>
Additions to the uniform are unacceptable without special permission. Reasonable hair<br> adornments, eyewear, and small jewelry (i.e. rings, necklaces, earrings) are exempt<br> from this. Excessive jewelry may be confiscated by faculty.<br>
Students may dress casually during Hogsmeade weekends, if they have permission to visit <br>Hogsmeade.<br>
<b>Magic</b><br>
Magic should only be used by students in relation to school work, or approved <br><br>extracurricular activities.<br>
Students may cast spells appropriate to their studies in classrooms and other study <br>areas. Study areas include common rooms, and the Great Hall (when not being used for <br>meals).<br>
Magic that is not related to studies may only be cast with the permission and <br>supervision of a faculty member, Prefect, or Head Boy/Girl.<br>
Duelling may only be performed on the duelling stage (in the club room), under the <br>direct supervision of a faculty member or Prefect.<br><br>
Students always have the right to use magic to defend themselves, or to respond to an <br>emergency.<br>
<b>Attendance</b><br>
Students must attend all classes, meals, and assemblies that they are scheduled for.<br>
Only written or verbal permission from Madam Spleen or a Professor can excuse <br>absenteeism.<br>
Hogwarts is a boarding school full of eyes (students, faculty, ghosts, Peeves, <br>paintings, etc.), making it just about impossible to get away with playing hooky. If you<br> skip classes, you will be caught and disciplined. Discipline consists, at the very<br> least, of loss of house points and detention.<br>
The requirement on attending all meals is rather loosely enforced. The faculty is <br>understanding, but also knows that skipped meals are a great time for students to be up<br> to no good. Head counts are taken at every meal, and a student that shows a pattern<br> of frequent absence will be warned, and eventually disciplined.<br>
<b>Decorum and Behaviour</b><br>
Students shall maintain decorum and good behaviour at all times.<br>
Swearing, snogging, shouting in the halls, vandalism, fighting, provoking Peeves, and <br>releasing puffskeins in Mr. Pringle's office during mating season are strictly forbidden.<br>
During breakfast and dinner meals, all students are required to remain at their house <br>tables for the duration of the meal. During lunchtime meals, this rule is less strictly<br> enforced, and will only take effect if problems arise.<br>
<b>Alcohol and Tobacco</b><br>
Alcohol and tobacco are strictly prohibited on Hogwarts grounds. Butterbeer may be<br> consumed in Hogsmeade, but may not be brought back to the school.<br>
Discipline</CENTER></p>
