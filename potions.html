Potions is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires <br>the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures. <br>Snape's lessons are depicted as unhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in <br>the basement of the castle, whilst Slughorn's, who replaces Snape as Potions Master, <br>is shown as more cheerful and even fun at times. The teachers of this class have been <br><br>Professor Horace Slughorn (?-1981) (1996-?) and Professor Severus Snape (1981-1996).<br>
