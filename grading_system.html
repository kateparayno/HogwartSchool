<h3> Grading System</h3>
<p>Grading on routine homework seems to be along the same lines as that for Muggle <br>students. Hogwarts students also have difficult exams as they progress higher in the  <br>
system. O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) are a set of standardised tests for <br>fifth-year students which determine what courses a student may continue to study in <br>their final years at Hogwarts. N.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) are <br>optional levels of education for exceptional students, much like A levels for Muggle <br>students. To progress to N.E.W.T.-level, students must receive certain high marks on <br>O.W.L. exams. N.E.W.T tests occur at the end of the seventh year and cannot be <br>retaken.</p>
<p>
<b>O</b> - Outstanding (Pass, always continue to N.E.W.T.) <br>
<b>E</b>- Exceeds Expectations (Pass, usually continues to N.E.W.T.)<br>
<b>A</b> - Acceptable (Pass, rarely continues to N.E.W.T)<br>
<b>P</b> - Poor (Fail, may repeat subject)<br>
<b>D</b> - Dreadful (Fail, may not receive O.W.L. credit)<br>
<b>T</b> - Troll (Fail, with distinction. More than one T may mean refusal into other N.E.W.T.s)<br>
This grading system is also used on W.O.M.B.A.T.s (optional tests taken outside Hogwarts) and it is most likely used on N.E.W.T.s also, making this the universal exam grading system in wizarding Britain.</p>
