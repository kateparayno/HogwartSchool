<h3> Muggle Studies </h3><br>

<p>
Muggle Studies is a class taught by Charity Burbage which involves the study of the <br>Muggle (non-magical) culture "from a wizarding point of view." It also includes Muggle <br>Art and Muggle Music. The only need for witches and wizards to learn about Muggle <br>ways and means is to ensure they can blend in with Muggles while needing to do so <br>(for example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). As the class is only mentioned as being <br>taken by Hermione, and for just one year, little is known about its curriculum.<br>
<br>
Voldemort murdered Professor Charity Burbage because she portrays Muggles in a positive<br> light and is opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of pure-blood origins. For<br> the rest of that academic year, Alecto Carrow, a Death Eater, teaches Muggle <br>Studies. However, her lessons (which are made compulsory) mainly describe Muggles and <br>Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution. The known teachers of this subject<br> have been Professor Quirinus Quirrell (?-1990), Male Professor (1990-1993), <br>Professor Charity Burbage (1993-1997), and Professor Alecto Carrow (1997-1998)..</p>
