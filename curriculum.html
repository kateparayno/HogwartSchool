<b>First year</b> <br>
Hogwarts boats 1 <br>
The first year students on their way to Hogwarts
A first year is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is new to <br>Hogwarts and in their first year of magical education. First years are typically <br>eleven to twelve years of age. First years arrive at the castle by crossing the lake <br><br>with the Keeper of the Keys in boats separate from the older students. They are <br>not <br>allowed to own a broomstick or be on one unless they are attending Flying <br> class. An exception had been made for Harry because he joined the Gryffindor house team<br> due to his exceptional skills with a broomstick. First year classes consist of <br>Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, <br>Astronomy, Charms, and Flying.<br>
<br>
<b>Second year</b><br>
Hogwarts carriages<br>
School carriages being pulled to Hogwarts castle<br>
A second year is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is in <br>their second year of magical education. Second years are typically twelve to thirteen <br>years of age unless a student had to repeat the second form. The second year is the <br>first year in which students are allowed to go with the rest of the school in the<br> school carriages pulled by Thestrals up to the castle. Second year classes consist of <br>Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of <br>Magic, Astronomy, and Charms. Unlike first years, the second-years' timetable does not <br>include Flying, although they are allowed to bring their own broomsticks. At the end <br>of the year, second-year students choose two or more classes they wish to study as <br>electives the following year.<br>
<br>
<b>Third year</b><br>
Hogsmeade High St<br>
Year in which students visit Hogsmeade<br>
A third year is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is in their<br> third year of magical education. Third years are typically thirteen to fourteen <br>years of age. The third year is an important one for students, as it is the first year <br>that they are permitted to sit elective courses. Third year classes consist of <br>Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, <br>Astronomy, Charms, and the two or more electives the student chose the previous <br>year. Third years are permitted to go to Hogsmeade during certain weekends if they have <br>a signed permission form from their parent/guardian.<br>
<br>
<b>Fourth year</b><br>
A fourth year is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is in <br>their fourth year of magical education. Fourth years are typically fourteen to fifteen <br><br>years of age. The fourth form is almost identical in its structure to the third; <br>students sit two or more elective courses in addition to the core classes and are <br>allowed in Hogsmeade during selected weekends. Fourth year classes consist of <br>Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, History of Magic, <br>Astronomy, Charms, and two or more electives. Although, fourth years typically get <br>more work than third years, to prepare for their O.W.L.s.<br>
<br>
<b>Fifth year</b><br>
OWLS 1996<br>
O.W.L. examination<br>
A fifth year is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is in their <br>fifth year of magical education. Fifth years are typically fifteen to sixteen years<br> of age. The fifth year is enormously important for students, due to the fact that <br>it is the year in which they must sit their O.W.L. exams, which will determine what <br>N.E.W.T. courses they will be permitted to take later on in their education. O.W.L.s <br>determine what jobs they can apply for in their future careers. The fifth year is <br>also the year in which students receive career counselling from their Heads of <br>House. It is during this meeting that they will be advised as to what N.E.W.T.-level <br>classes they should take in order to qualify for their desired career. Fifth year <br>classes consist of Potions, Herbology, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, <br>History of Magic, Astronomy, Charms, and two or more electives. Before the beginning <br>of the year, one boy and one girl are selected by the Headmaster from each house to<br><br> become prefects.<br>
<br>
<b>Sixth year</b><br>
Slughorn pottermore<br>
N.E.W.T-level Potions lesson<br>
A sixth year is a student who is in his or her sixth year of magical education at<br> Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Sixth years are typically sixteen to <br>seventeen years of age, although some may be older, if they have had to repeat a year <br>like Marcus Flint did. The sixth year is the first year in which students sit <br>N.E.W.T.-level classes. Sixth years may also elect to take part in Apparition lessons <br>for a fee of twelve Galleons.<br>
<br>
Based on students O.W.L. scores, and depending on the minimum requirements of the <br><br>professor teaching the subject at that time, students are allowed to sit any number of<br> classes as long as they meet said requirements. If the student doesn't meet <br>those requirements, they cannot attend the N.E.W.T.-level classes, having to repeat the<br> O.W.L.-level classes and the fifth-year exams. While students do have the <br>opportunity to choose whether they wish to continue in particular subjects, those who<br> begin studying N.E.W.T.-level subjects in their sixth year are expected to carry on<br> with the subject into the seventh year and sit the N.E.W.T. exam in that subject. <br>Sixth-year students are initially excited to have more free time, but this extra time<br> is intended to help them study and do homework, as many, if not all, teachers assign<br> more homework and give more difficult lessons in their N.E.W.T.-level classes.<br>
<br>
<b>Seventh year</b><br>
HeadBoyPin<br>
A seventh year is a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who is in <br>their seventh and final year of formal magical education. Seventh years are typically <br>seventeen to eighteen years of age, although some may be older if they have had to <br>repeat a year. The seventh year contains the most important exams given at Hogwarts <br>- the N.E.W.T.s. Students conclude their N.E.W.T.-level studies in the seventh year,<br> at the end of which they sit the N.E.W.T. exam pertaining to each of their <br>subjects. A student in the seventh year would have the same schedule he or she had in <br>the sixth year and would sit only those classes in which they received O.W.L.s <br>meeting the minimum requirement of the professor for that subject. However, not all <br>students take N.E.W.T.s, as some occupations require only O.W.L.s.<br>
<br>
Every year, a male and female seventh year are appointed Head Boy and Head Girl. In <br>most cases, the Headmaster selects the Head students from the seventh year prefects. <br>However, students that have never been prefects, for example Hary's dad James Potter, <br>can still be selected.<br>
