Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., is the class that teaches<br> students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected<br> from Dark creatures.<br>
<br>
The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members â€” throughout Harry <br>Potter's time at Hogwarts, no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has remained at<br> Hogwarts for more than one school year. These included Quirinus Quirrell, Gilderoy<br> Lockhart, Remus Lupin, Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody,<br> Dolores Umbridge, Severus Snape, and Amycus Carrow. Hagrid suggested that "They're<br> startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now." Dumbledore<br> suggested that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was<br> rejected. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as<br> well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in 1996. After the end of the<br> Second Wizarding War, the jinx on the position was lifted. Harry Potter would<br> occasionally come to the class to give lectures on the subject.<br>
<br>
The teachers of this class have been Professor Galatea Merrythought (c. 1895-1945),<br> Professor Quirinus Quirrell (1991-1992), Professor Gilderoy Lockhart (1992-1993),<br> Professor Remus Lupin (1993-1994), Barty Crouch Jr (impersonating Professor Alastor<br><br> Moody) (1994-1995), Professor Dolores Umbridge (1995-1996), Professor Severus Snape<br> (1996-1997), and Professor Amycus Carrow (Dark Arts) (1997-1998).<br>
