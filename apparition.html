Apparition is the magical form of teleportation in the wizarding world. Lessons are <br>optional to those in the sixth and seventh years. In the wizarding world, performing<br> Apparition requires a licence and may only be legally performed by people over seventeen<br> years of age. The described reason for the restriction is that Apparition is<br> dangerous if done improperly: insufficient concentration may lead to body parts being<br> left behind in an unfortunate side-effect known as splinching. Although, as Hermione<br> points out innumerable times throughout the series, magical enchantments on Hogwarts<br> castle and grounds prevent Apparition and Disapparition inside the castle, these<br> protections are temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit<br> students to practise Apparition. Wilkie Twycross, a Ministry of Magic Apparition<br> Instructor, offers lessons in Apparition to sixth-years.<br></p>
