<b>UNIFORM</b><br>
The students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are required to wear a <br>uniform. Students must wear their uniforms during all lessons, and while eating meals or<br> studying in the Great Hall. Students are allowed to wear their own clothes after<br> lessons in their House dormitory and during the holidays. Most students are seen still <br>wearing their uniforms in their house dormitory, most probably because they would<br><br> need to change into their pyjamas to sleep before they go to bed, so they may feel that<br> it is troublesome to change into their own clothes, then change again into <br>their pyjamas.<br>

The Hogwarts uniform worn in the books consists of a black robe and a black pointed hat.<br> The robes bear no marks to distinguish between the houses. Students wear their own <br>socks and shoes.<br>
<br>
The uniform portrayed in the films consists of a white collared, long sleeved shirt, a<br> tie of their house colours (getting more sophisticated each year), a grey jumper vest,<br> black slacks for males and a black, knee length skirt for females paired with black <br>or grey socks. Both genders wear black comfortable shoes. Each student wears a cloak <br>that bears their house crest on the front, right side and has a lining of their house <br>color: green for Slytherin, red for Gryffindor, blue for Ravenclaw, and yellow for <br>Hufflepuff. During the winter months, a grey jumper replaces the jumper vest for <br>comfort and a scarf bearing their two house colours is worn for warmth. A black pointed <br>hat is provided but is only worn for special occasions such as the opening ceremony,<br> special dinners, house cup ceremony etc.<br>
